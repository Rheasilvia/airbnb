## Installation 

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation 
- This is the first project of Udacity Data Scientist Term 2.
- In this report,we will use data analysis about the dataset and answer three questions.
	- Is there any relationship between 'price' and 'review_score_rate'?
	- Is there any pattern between other scores with price ?
	- Is there any pattern between the location and the price?

## File Descriptions
- The notebook 'airbnb.ipynb' strives to answer some chosen question using simple exploratory data analysis, and descriptive statistics on the airbnb dataset. This notebook follows on lines of Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)

- 'airbnb.html' is the static html version of the notebook.

Create the 'data' folder in the root path. Please compress the data sets into this directory.

Both data sets contain the following files:

- calendar set (calendar.csv) : Including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
- listings set (listings.csv) : Including full descriptions and average review score.
- reviews set (reviews.csv) :Including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments. 

## Results 
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://shannon-online.com/).

## Summary
In the report, we will find that although the data of Seattle and Boston are different, the analysis of data characteristics shows that there is a certain correlation between price and region, as well as the evaluation of housing.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available in Seattle AirBNB [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) and Boston AirBNB [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).And the original source can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
